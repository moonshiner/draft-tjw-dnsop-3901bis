1.  Introduction

   The Internet is well on its way to a mixture of IPv4 and IPv6
   networks.  The concern is that a resolver using only a particular
   version of IP and querying information about another node using the
   same version of IP can not do it because somewhere in the chain of
   servers accessed during the resolution process, one or more of them
   will only be accessible with the other version of IP.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.  DNS terminology is as described in
   [RFC8499].

   The phrase "IPv4 name server" indicates a name server available over
   IPv4 transport.  It does not imply anything about what DNS [RFC1034]
   [RFC1035] data is served.  Likewise, "IPv6 name server" [RFC2460]
   [RFC3513] [RFC3596] indicates a name server available over IPv6
   transport.  The phrase "dual-stack name server" indicates a name
   server that is actually configured to run both protocols, IPv4 and
   IPv6, and not merely a server running on a system capable of running
   both but actually configured to run only one.

3.  Name Space Fragmentation: following the referral chain

   A resolver that tries to look up a name starts out at the root, and
   follows referrals until it is referred to a name server that is
   authoritative for the name.  If somewhere down the chain of referrals
   it is referred to a name server that is only accessible over a
   transport which the resolver cannot use, the resolver is unable to
   finish the task.

   With all DNS data only available over IPv4 transport everything is
   simple.  IPv4 resolvers can use the intended mechanism of following
   referrals from the root and down while IPv6 resolvers have to work
   through a "translator", i.e., they have to use a recursive name
   server on a so-called "dual stack" host as a "forwarder" since they
   cannot access the DNS data directly.

   With all DNS data only available over IPv6 transport everything would
   be equally simple, with the exception of IPv4 recursive name servers
   having to switch to a forwarding configuration.

   The transition from IPv4 only to a mixture of IPv4 and IPv6, with
   three categories of DNS data depending on whether the information is
   available only over IPv4 transport, only over IPv6 or both.

   Having DNS data available on both transports is the optimal
   situation.

4.  Policy Based Avoidance of Name Space Fragmentation

   Today there are only a small number of DNS zones that are available
   over IPv6-only.

   The recommended approach to maintain name space continuity is to use
   administrative policies, as described in the next section.

5.  DNS IPv6 Transport recommended Guidelines

   In order to preserve name space continuity, the following
   administrative policies are recommended:

   *  every recursive name server SHOULD support the local network
      configuration.  If the local network supports both IPv4 and IPv5,
      the resolver SHOULD be dual stack.

   *  If the service is offering IPv4 as a Service (IPv4aaS), the
      recursive name server SHOULD accept IPv6, and support dual stack
      recursive methods.

   *  every authorative DNS zone SHOULD be dual stack IPv4/IPv6.

   A DNS zone can be served by at least one IPv4-reachable authoritative
   name server.

   This rules out DNS zones served only by IPv6-only authoritative name
   servers.

   Note: zone validation processes SHOULD ensure that there is at least
   one IPv4 address record available for the name servers of any child
   delegations within the zone.

6.  IANA Considerations

   None

7.  Security Considerations

   None
